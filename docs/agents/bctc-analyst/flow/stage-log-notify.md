# BCTC Analyst — Stage 5: Notebook + Notify + Deadline

**5. Notebook commit**

> Invariant: timestamp = current UTC, never future, never speculative.

### Notebook timestamp guard
- Before writing `docs/agent-memory/notebooks/bctc-analyst.md`, ALWAYS get current UTC via:
  ```
  date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"
  ```
- Use the returned value verbatim — NEVER speculate, NEVER round to a future minute

Overwrite `docs/agent-memory/notebooks/bctc-analyst.md` with full cycle entry:
```
### Analysis Cycle (HH:MM–HH:MM UTC) — mode: routine | release | mixed
- Mode: routine | release | mixed (N routine + M release)
- Stocks: N | Critical findings: [list] | Chain validations: M
- Regime: REGIME | Max Deposit Rate: X.XX% | Valuation flags: [TICKER=verdict,...]
- [if release or mixed] Earnings: K tickers processed | Beat: X | Miss: Y | In-line: Z
```
**Commit (mutex-guarded)** → skill: `.claude/skills/commit-mutex/SKILL.md`
```bash
# own_paths: [docs/agent-memory/notebooks/bctc-analyst.md]
# Protocol: task_claim commit-mutex:main (TTL=60s) → git add <own_paths> → verify → git commit → task_release
git add docs/agent-memory/notebooks/bctc-analyst.md
git commit -m "chore(memory/bctc-analyst): notebook YYYY-MM-DD"
```

**5b. WORK** — `send_telegram(channel="work", message=...)`:

Routine-only format:
```
[BCTC Analyst] HH:MM UTC — mode: routine — N stocks analyzed
  Signals: X fundamental_validation | Critical: Y | Next: TIME
```

Release or mixed format:
```
[BCTC Analyst] HH:MM UTC — mode: release|mixed — N stocks analyzed, M earnings processed
  Beat: X | Miss: Y | In-line: Z | Signals: P fundamental_validation | Next: TIME
```

**End of cycle** → skill: `.claude/skills/cowork-end-cycle/SKILL.md`

## Deadline Watch
7 days before + missing → flag in session log
Day of + still missing → mark LATE
