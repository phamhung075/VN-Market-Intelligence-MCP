**task-id:** FIX-SEQUENTIAL-ANALYSIS-TOOL-DEAD-HANDLER
**what-done:** Fixed `sequential_market_analysis` registration in sequential-market-analysis.ts — moved `handler: tool.handle` from a nested config key to the SDK's required 3rd positional callback arg of `server.registerTool(name, config, cb)`.
**what-considered:**
- Nested `handler` key inside config object (the pre-existing broken shape) — SDK's registerTool destructures only title/description/inputSchema/outputSchema/annotations/_meta from config, silently dropping an unknown `handler` key, leaving `cb` undefined
- Switch to legacy `server.tool(name, description, schema, cb)` pattern used by all other tools — rejected: unnecessary churn, registerTool is the SDK's non-deprecated modern API and the config shape (title/description/inputSchema) was already otherwise correct
**why-decision:** Root cause confirmed by reading SDK source (mcp.js `registerTool(name,config,cb){...cb}` and `_createRegisteredTool(...,handler)` stores `handler: handler` directly) — 3rd positional arg is mandatory; minimal 1-call fix, no logic touched.
**why-change:** no change — task scope was exactly this registration-shape bug.
