# QA — Notebook

**Last updated:** 2026-05-03 | **Sprint:** 1846

## Last session summary

QA review of task 1846b (backtest lifecycle tools). delete_backtest_run (#123) + export_backtest_run_csv (#124) + compare_backtest_runs (#125). 19/19 targeted tests pass. 3 merge conflicts resolved (clean additive — branch diverged from 1842d pre-1844a). tsc: 0 errors. DDD: clean. No process.env. Merged to main 9c17a54f. Sprint 1846 complete.

## Known patterns / preferences

- Bun v1.3.11 had a known C++ panic crash on large test suites (macOS x64). Upgraded to v1.3.13 in Sprint 1836 (U-1). If developers report unexpectedly high failure counts, check Bun version first.
- Bun v1.3.13 still crashes with OOM on the full 791-file suite when run from the root `apps/mcp-server` directory (peak 1.97 GB). Run targeted tests from apps/mcp-server with `bun test <filter>` for reliable results.
- IMPORTANT: tests must be run from `apps/mcp-server/` to pick up `bunfig.toml` preload (setup.ts sets DB_PATH=:memory:). Running from repo root causes SQLiteError: unable to open database file for all tests.
- `apps/mcp-server/data/` is git-ignored. Since 1845b (setup.ts mkdirSync fix), main creates these dirs automatically. Worktrees branched BEFORE 1845b will still show 106 ENOENT failures — not regressions.
- Pre-existing failures (as of Sprint 1846 baseline): 1 (Task 1331a TEST-3 RED guard). Stable.
- Always verify AC-by-AC: do not bulk-approve. Each acceptance criterion in the handoff must be ticked with evidence.
- DDD check is non-negotiable even for "small" fixes: `grep -r "from.*infrastructure" <modified_domain_files>` must return nothing (comments only are fine).
- `docs/data/` is in `.gitignore` — if project-stats.json is updated, confirm `git add -f` was used.
- Task report format: Compact for fix/≤3 files, Full for new tool/domain service/security change.
- Check pre-existing fail count matches expected BEFORE approving. If test count differs by more than 10, ask developer to recount.
- tsc must be 0 errors — even 1 warning-level type error is a blocker if it touches production code paths.
- worktree project-stats.json may be stale (worktree branched from old commit). Always compare with main's version and keep the more current one during conflict resolution.
- When branch diverges from an old commit (e.g. 1842d), expect merge conflicts. Pattern: worktree adds features on top of 1842d state; main has 1844a+1845x already. Conflicts are always additive — accept both sides.
- export_backtest_run_csv AC: must return raw text not JSON.stringify. Check line with `return { content: [{ type: "text" as const, text: csvString }] }` — no JSON.stringify wrapper.

## Carry-over for next session

- Sprint 1846 DONE: 1846b APPROVED and merged. toolCount=128, totalTasksDone=515.
- Pre-existing failure set (1 as of 1846): Task 1331a TEST-3 (RED guard — intentional).
- Next task unknown — pipeline-state.json status=idle, waiting for PO.
