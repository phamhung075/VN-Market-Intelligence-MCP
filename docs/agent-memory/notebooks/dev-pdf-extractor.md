### 2026-05-11 — 1870a FPT BCTC verify FAIL

FPT PDF layout: balance sheet (pages 4-7, VND), income stmt labels only (page 8), giải trình (page 9, triệu), cash flow (page 10, VND).

Known trap: `P_NET_PROFIT = /l[ợo]i\s+nhu[ậa]n\s+sau\s+thu[ếe]/i` matches balance-sheet item 421 "Lợi nhuận sau thuế chưa phân phối". Fix: add `(?!\s+ch[ưu]a\s+ph[âa]n\s+ph[ốo]i)` negative lookahead.

Corruption note: running `bun -e` while container is alive causes SQLITE_CORRUPT. Always use `docker exec <container> bun -e` from within running container process — this is safe. The issue was the two processes sharing WAL. Recovery via alpine sqlite3 `.recover` worked.

Disk-scan only repopulates MISSING rows (cnt=0). To force reparse of an existing bad row: DELETE the row first, then trigger scan.

1870b follow-up: P_NET_PROFIT fix in `apps/mcp-server/src/domain/services/financial-reports/incomeStatementExtractor.ts`.
